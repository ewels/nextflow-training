# Environment setup

There are two main ways to get started with Seqeraâ€™s Nextflow training course.

The first is to install the requirements locally ([Local installation](#local-installation)), which is best if you are already familiar with Git and Docker, or working offline.

The second is to use [Gitpod](#gitpod), which is best for first-timers as this platform contains all the programs and data required. Simply click the link and log in using your GitHub account to start the tutorial:
