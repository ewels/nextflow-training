# Channels

Channels are a key data structure of Nextflow that allows the implementation of reactive-functional oriented computational workflows based on the [Dataflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) programming paradigm.

They are used to logically connect tasks to each other or to implement functional style data transformations.
